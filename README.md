In this project I performed the following actions:
-Built a database
-Analyzed and retrieved data with SQL
-Connect Power BI to a database
-Visualize data in Power BI

The dashboard answered these three questions: 
a) Is the hotel growing by year? (Yes)
b) Should the parking lot size be increased? (No enough evidence) 
c) What trends can we see in the data ? 
-Yearly increase in revenue from 2018 
-City Hotel generates more revenue than resort hotel
